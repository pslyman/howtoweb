Let's get you set up with the tools you'll need. 

1. Your IDE (Integrated Development Environment), **Visual Studio Code**. This is basically the text editor where you'll most of your programming. Download link: [https://code.​visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2.  **Git** (made by Github) is what will allow you to backup your code online, and have version control. It has a ton of other tools that you'll need. It'll ask you to customize your installation, but just keep clicking 'Next' until it finishes. The basic installation is all you need. Download link: [https://git-scm.com/​download](https://git-scm.com/download/)
3. **NodeJs.** This helps with package management and commands down the road. Download link: [https://nodejs.org/en/​download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (probably LTS, 64-bit will be best)
4. (optional). Also install this: [https://desktop.github.​com/](https://desktop.github.com/) . Git is all terminal based (like command prompt), but **Github Desktop** is the graphical interface that you can use once you've learned the commands. 
5. Also, bookmark these in Chrome so you have them for later:

Their account here has a lot of sample projects they use for their lessons. If you want to go the extra mile, they may come in handy. 
* <https://www.w3schools.com/> ​This site is like a glossary for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I reference all the time when I forget stuff. 
* <https://github.com/> This is where you'll backup your code. Go ahead and create a free account now.
