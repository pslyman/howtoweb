* **Code editor** - This is where you will write and edit your code. Has tabs like a browser to help manage many open files. 
* **Terminal** - Think of PowerShell, Command Prompt, or Git Bash. Basically just a **command window** where you can install packages, run tasks, start a server, etc. 
* **Files** - This is a tree view of the folder you're coding out of on your computer. Much like File Explorer or Finder (Mac), but more convenient to use. This left-hand section can also be occupied by a few different menus, shown below:

### Hotkeys: 

* Ctrl S = Save file
* Ctrl K, S = Save all files
* Ctrl P = Jump to file by name
* Alt Ctrl F = Format code (select Prettier from dropdown)
* Ctrl F = Search in this file
* Ctrl Shift F = Search in all files (global search)
* Ctrl ` (above Tab key) = Open or Close Terminal
* Ctrl Tab = Switch to last file
* Ctrl Shift Tab (and remain holding Ctrl Shift) = See list of most recently opened files, then Tab through to one needed

If I think of more, I'll add them here.
